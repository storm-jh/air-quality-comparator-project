## Project Overview
Brief summary of the project, its purpose, and the main insights.

---

## Datasets
- 2 sources of data were obtained. 1 kaggle dataset as described below
- Satellite data was 
- Source: [Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airqualityanthony/uk-defra-aurn-air-quality-data-2015-2023)
- Description: .csv, 1.86GB, contains ground measurement data for UK air pollution between 2015 and 2023. It includes several pollutants including Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Oxides, Nitrogen Dioxide, Nitric Oxide, Ozone, and Sulphur Dioxide.

- Licensing is stated as other, with no further information in the description.

## Problem Statement
- We are attempting to discover whether open source satellite data is sufficiently correlated with collected ground data for air pollution. If this is the case, we can infer what the ground readings would be from satellite data, reducing the need for ground instrument readings, thus reducing the associated cost.
